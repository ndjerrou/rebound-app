# Rebound - E commerce App

Welcome to the Rebound Github project page


!! This project uses React for the front end part and Wordpress for the back end part hence, the configuration to get started is a little bit different of what u've been used to before.


## How to get started ?

- Grab the Wordpress Theme by extracting it from the WP Dashboard

- Create a local server using the LocalWP Software (made by flywheel)

- Download this project

- Install the project(or theme) inside the themes folders on your local server

- You should be working on the `react-src` folder : it's your development environment

- Inside this particular folder, launch the ```npm i``` command to install the dependencies

- Launch the project by typing ```npm start```

You should have already launched your server with LocalWP.
